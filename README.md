# MiSTer_launchsync
My MiSTer FPGA Launch Sync files
I created a folder called _LaunchSync on the root of my MiSTer FPGA SD card and placed my .sync files there.
Run launchsync.sh to update the game list.  

More info about MiSTer LaunchSync can be found here including the script file (launchsync.sh):
